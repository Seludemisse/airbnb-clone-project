👥 Team Roles
The success of this project depends on effective collaboration across multiple roles. Each team member brings specific expertise and responsibility to ensure the application is robust, scalable, and well-architected.

🔧 Backend Developer
Responsible for building and maintaining the server-side logic of the application. This includes designing RESTful APIs and GraphQL endpoints, managing data flow, integrating third-party services, and ensuring code quality and performance.

Designs and manages the project’s relational database (MySQL). Ensures data is structured efficiently, maintains data integrity, and optimizes queries for performance. Also responsible for backups and migrations.

🔐 Security Engineer
Focuses on securing the application at all levels. Implements authentication and authorization mechanisms (e.g., JWT), validates user input to prevent vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, XSS), and sets up secure API access policies.

🧪 QA Engineer / Tester
Writes and executes test cases to ensure the application meets quality standards. Covers unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end testing. Helps catch bugs early and ensure reliable deployment.

🛠 DevOps / Deployment Lead
Sets up and maintains CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment. Manages environment variables, server configuration, and release strategies. Ensures smooth and repeatable deployments.

📖 Technical Writer / Documentation Lead
Maintains up-to-date documentation of API endpoints, data models, setup instructions, and contribution guidelines. Ensures the project is accessible and understandable for all collaborators and future contributors.

🎯 Project Manager / Scrum Lead (Optional Role for Large Teams)
Facilitates team coordination by managing timelines, assigning tasks, organizing meetings, and ensuring alignment with project goals. Uses tools like GitHub Projects, issues, and milestones to track progress.

🧰 Technology Stack
This project utilizes a modern backend-focused tech stack designed for scalability, security, and collaboration. Each technology plays a key role in delivering a functional and maintainable Airbnb-like platform.

Technology	Purpose in the Project
Django	A high-level Python web framework used to build the backend of the application, handle routing, models, views, and manage admin functionality.

MySQL	A reliable relational database management system used to store structured data such as user profiles, bookings, listings, and reviews.

GraphQL	An API query language that provides a flexible way for the frontend to interact with backend data, reducing over-fetching and under-fetching of information.

RESTful API	A conventional web API standard used for CRUD operations; complements GraphQL for services that require simpler, resource-oriented architecture.

Git & GitHub	Used for version control, team collaboration, and managing pull requests, issues, and branches throughout the development process.

JWT (JSON Web Tokens)	Provides secure user authentication by issuing tokens on login that verify identity and access rights across protected routes.

CI/CD (GitHub Actions)	Automates testing and deployment pipelines to ensure new changes are safely integrated into production environments.

Django Test Framework / Pytest	Used to write unit and integration tests to validate logic and prevent regressions during development.

🗄️ Database Design
The application uses a relational database (MySQL) to manage data. Below are the key entities, their important fields, and relationships between them.

🧑 Users
Represents guests or hosts using the platform.

id (Primary Key)

username

email

password_hash

role (guest or host)

Relationships:

A user can create multiple properties (if they are a host).

A user can make multiple bookings.

A user can leave multiple reviews.

🏠 Properties
Listings created by hosts for rent.

id (Primary Key)

host_id (Foreign Key → Users)

title

description

location

price_per_night

Relationships:

A property belongs to one user (host).

A property can have many bookings.

A property can have many reviews.

📆 Bookings
Tracks reservations made by users.

id (Primary Key)

user_id (Foreign Key → Users)

property_id (Foreign Key → Properties)

start_date

end_date

total_price

Relationships:

A booking belongs to one user and one property.

📝 Reviews

✨ Feature Breakdown
The Airbnb Clone Project replicates the core functionalities of the Airbnb platform to provide a full-stack learning experience. Below are the main features that define the platform's capabilities.

👤 User Management
Users can register, log in, and manage their profiles. Role-based access allows for both guests (who book properties) and hosts (who list properties), with secure authentication using JWT.

🏠 Property Management
Hosts can create, update, and delete listings. Each listing includes property details such as location, description, price, and availability, allowing guests to browse and search for options that meet their needs.

📆 Booking System
Registered users can book available properties for specific dates. The system checks for conflicts, calculates total cost, and stores booking records tied to users and properties.

💳 Payment Integration
A simulated payment system allows users to complete bookings by submitting payment details. Payments are tied to specific bookings and tracked for confirmation, refunds, or status updates.

📝 Reviews & Ratings
Users can leave reviews and star ratings for properties they’ve stayed in. These reviews help future guests make informed decisions and provide feedback to hosts.

🔒 Authentication & Authorization
JWT-based authentication ensures secure access to protected endpoints. Role-based permissions restrict actions to authorized users (e.g., only hosts can manage listings).

🛠 Admin Panel (Django Admin)
The Django admin interface provides administrative control over all entities—users, listings, bookings, and payments—making it easy to manage and monitor the platform's data.

🔍 Search & Filtering (Planned/Optional)
Users will be able to search listings by location, price, and availability. Advanced filtering options may be added to enhance discoverability.

🔐 API Security
Security is a critical aspect of the Airbnb Clone project to protect sensitive user data, ensure safe transactions, and maintain trust in the platform. Below are the key security measures implemented in the backend APIs:

🔑 Authentication
We use JWT (JSON Web Tokens) to verify the identity of users securely. Authentication ensures that only registered users can access protected resources, such as booking properties or managing listings, preventing unauthorized access.

🚦 Authorization
Role-based access control restricts actions based on user roles (e.g., guest vs. host). This prevents users from performing unauthorized operations like modifying others’ listings or bookings, preserving data integrity and privacy.

🛡️ Data Validation & Sanitization
All incoming data is validated and sanitized to prevent common attacks such as SQL injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), protecting the application and database from malicious inputs.

💳 Secure Payment Handling
Payment-related endpoints implement additional security measures, including encrypted communication (HTTPS) and validation checks, to safeguard sensitive financial information during transactions.
