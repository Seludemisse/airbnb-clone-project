# Airbnb Clone Project

## 🏡 About the Project

The **Airbnb Clone Project** is a comprehensive, real-world application designed to simulate the development of a robust booking platform similar to Airbnb. This project replicates the core functionalities of Airbnb, focusing on full-stack development practices. Learners will explore backend systems, API architecture, database design, application security, and deployment workflows.

This project is part of the ALX Software Engineering curriculum, aimed at building scalable, production-ready applications while fostering deep understanding of modern development workflows and collaborative engineering.

👥 Team Roles
The success of this project depends on effective collaboration across multiple roles. Each team member brings specific expertise and responsibility to ensure the application is robust, scalable, and well-architected.

🔧 Backend Developer
Responsible for building and maintaining the server-side logic of the application. This includes designing RESTful APIs and GraphQL endpoints, managing data flow, integrating third-party services, and ensuring code quality and performance.

🗄️ Database Administrator (DBA)
Designs and manages the project’s relational database (MySQL). Ensures data is structured efficiently, maintains data integrity, and optimizes queries for performance. Also responsible for backups and migrations.

🔐 Security Engineer
Focuses on securing the application at all levels. Implements authentication and authorization mechanisms (e.g., JWT), validates user input to prevent vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, XSS), and sets up secure API access policies.

🧪 QA Engineer / Tester
Writes and executes test cases to ensure the application meets quality standards. Covers unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end testing. Helps catch bugs early and ensure reliable deployment.

🛠 DevOps / Deployment Lead
Sets up and maintains CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment. Manages environment variables, server configuration, and release strategies. Ensures smooth and repeatable deployments.

📖 Technical Writer / Documentation Lead
Maintains up-to-date documentation of API endpoints, data models, setup instructions, and contribution guidelines. Ensures the project is accessible and understandable for all collaborators and future contributors.

🎯 Project Manager / Scrum Lead (Optional Role for Large Teams)
Facilitates team coordination by managing timelines, assigning tasks, organizing meetings, and ensuring alignment with project goals. Uses tools like GitHub Projects, issues, and milestones to track progress.

🧰 Technology Stack
This project utilizes a modern backend-focused tech stack designed for scalability, security, and collaboration. Each technology plays a key role in delivering a functional and maintainable Airbnb-like platform.

Technology	Purpose in the Project
Django	A high-level Python web framework used to build the backend of the application, handle routing, models, views, and manage admin functionality.

MySQL	A reliable relational database management system used to store structured data such as user profiles, bookings, listings, and reviews.

GraphQL	An API query language that provides a flexible way for the frontend to interact with backend data, reducing over-fetching and under-fetching of information.

RESTful API	A conventional web API standard used for CRUD operations; complements GraphQL for services that require simpler, resource-oriented architecture.

Git & GitHub	Used for version control, team collaboration, and managing pull requests, issues, and branches throughout the development process.

JWT (JSON Web Tokens)	Provides secure user authentication by issuing tokens on login that verify identity and access rights across protected routes.

CI/CD (GitHub Actions)	Automates testing and deployment pipelines to ensure new changes are safely integrated into production environments.

Django Test Framework / Pytest	Used to write unit and integration tests to validate logic and prevent regressions during development.
